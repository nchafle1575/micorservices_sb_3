# micorservices_sb_3

three MS are there and we need docker openzipkin/zipkin so that we can use it..... 

step to run this app.. 
step 1: docker run -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin:2.23   
         ( for this you need docker in the local.)
 step 2: you need to start all the MS in the local. ( just clone this services into local and run it).
